Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimated resident population is based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census.\n<br><br> SUDO has ingested this dataset in its GeoPackage format.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_maincode_2016","type":"String","title":"SA2 Main Code 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Main Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"gccsa_code_2016","type":"String","title":"GCCSA Code 2016","description":"Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"gccsa_name_2016","type":"String","title":"GCCSA Name 2016","description":"Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) Name from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa2_name_2016","type":"String","title":"SA2 Name 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Name from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa3_code_2016","type":"Integer","title":"SA3 Code 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa3_name_2016","type":"String","title":"SA3 Name 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) Name from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_code_2016","type":"Integer","title":"SA4 Code 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_name_2016","type":"String","title":"SA4 Name 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) Name from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"state_code_2016","type":"Integer","title":"State Code 2016","description":"State Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"state_name_2016","type":"String","title":"State Name 2016","description":"State Name from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"pop_density_2020_people_per_km2","type":"Double","title":"Population density - 2020","description":"Number of persons per square kilometre - 2020","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"area_km2","type":"Double","title":"Area (km2)","description":"Area in square kilometres","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa2_maincode_2016","geoLevel":"sa2_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
